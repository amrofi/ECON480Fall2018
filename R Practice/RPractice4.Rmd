# Intro to `dplyr` syntax

### 1. Load the `gapminder` and `tidyverse` packages. 

## `select()`

### 1. Make a data frame containing the columns `year`, `lifeExp`, `country` from the gapminder data, in that order.

### 2. Select all variables, from `country` to `lifeExp`. 

### 3. Select all variables, except `lifeExp`.

### 4. Rename `continent` to `cont`.

## `arrange()`

### 1. Order by year.

### 2. Order by year, in descending order.

### 3. Order by year, then by life expectancy.

## Piping, `%>%`

Note: think of `%>%` as the word "then"!

### 1. Combine `select()` Task 1 with `arrange()` Task 3.

## `filter()`

### 1. Only take data with population greater than 100 million.

### 2. Of those, only take data from Asia.

## `mutate()`

### 1. Make a new variable that is `GDP` instead of gdp per capita.

### 2. Make a new variable for GDP that is in millions 

### 3. Make a new population variable that is the population in millions. 

## `summarize()`

### 1. Get the average GDP per capita

### 2. Get the average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for GDP per capita.

### 3. Get the average for GDP per capita, Life expectancy, and population

## `group_by()`

### 1. Track the change in average GDP per capita over time. Hint, first group by year. 

### 2. Get the average GDP per capita by continent.
